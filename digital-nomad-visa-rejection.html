    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Top Reasons Digital Nomad Visas Get Rejected</h2>
    
    <ul class="space-y-6">
      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">1. Insufficient Proof of Income</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Many countries require a minimum monthly income to qualify. Submitting bank statements
          or contracts that do not meet the threshold is a common cause of rejection.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">2. Missing or Incorrect Documents</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Incomplete applications or documents with errors can lead to automatic rejection.
          Always double-check IDs, passports, photos, and proof of employment.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">3. Failure to Demonstrate Remote Work</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Visa authorities need proof that you work remotely for foreign clients or companies.
          Lack of contracts, invoices, or a portfolio can result in denial.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">4. Criminal Record or Security Concerns</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Some countries require a clean criminal background check. A prior conviction or
          security concern may lead to rejection.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">5. Inadequate Health Insurance</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Most digital nomad visas require valid health insurance covering the entire stay.
          Policies that do not meet the country’s minimum requirements can cause rejection.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-lg transition">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">6. Applying Too Late or Outside Processing Times</h3>
        <p class="text-slate-500 leading-relaxed">
          Submitting applications late or not allowing enough time for processing can lead to
          rejection. Always apply well in advance.
