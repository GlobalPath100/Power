      Portugal has become one of the most popular European destinations for remote workers
      and digital nomads. Its warm climate, vibrant culture, and relatively affordable
      cost of living attract professionals from around the world.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      In 2026, Portugal’s Digital Nomad Visa (D7 or alternative remote residency) offers a
      legal path to stay and work remotely. One of the most important aspects of this
      visa is the income requirement — knowing exactly how much money you need
      to qualify.
